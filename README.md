1)**Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?**

Vehicle Length and Ground Clearance provide non-random amounts of variance. This conclusion is the result of their P-Values. Vehicle Length has a P-Value of 5.08e^-8 ,and Ground Clearance has a P-Value of 5.21e^-8. Both of these P-values are far less than the standard P-value of 0.05. It is for this reason that we can reject the null hypothesis and assume that our results are non-random. 

2)**Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?**

The p-value of our model is 5.35e^-11, which is far below the standard p-value of 0.05. This implies that we can reject the null hypothesis, which implies that our slope is not zero. 

3)**Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?**

Yes, this model effectivley predicts mpg of MechaCar. This conclusion is the result of having a R-squared value of 0.71. This tells us that there is a strong correlation between our independent variables with the dependent variable.
